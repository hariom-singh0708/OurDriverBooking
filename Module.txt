🔷 Project Build Strategy (IMPORTANT)

We will NOT build everything together.

Instead we will follow this strict order:

Setup → Auth → Core Ride → Client Flow → Driver Flow → Live Tracking → Payment → Polish

Each module will have:

✅ Backend APIs + DB models

✅ Frontend pages + state

✅ Integration tested

✅ Then move to next module

🧠 HOW WE SHOULD PROCEED (My Recommendation)

👉 Next step:
We should start with MODULE 0 and I will:

Design exact folder structure

Write backend setup code

Write frontend setup code

Explain why each file exists

Then we move module by module.
